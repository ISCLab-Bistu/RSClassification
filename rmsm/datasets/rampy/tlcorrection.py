def tlcorrection(x,y,temp,wave, **kwargs):
    """correct spectra from temperature and excitation line effects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Raman shifts in cm-1
    y : ndarray
        Intensity values as counts
    temp : float
        Temperature in Â°C
    wave : float
        wavenumber of the laser that excited the sample, in nm
    correction : string, optional
        Equation used for the correction. Choose between 'long', 'galeener', or 'hehlen'. Default = 'long'.
    normalisation : string, optional
        Data normalisation procedure. Choose between 'intensity', 'area', or 'no'. Default = 'area'.
    density : float, optional
        The density of the studied material in kg m-3, to be used with the 'hehlen' equation. Default = 2210.0 (density of silica).

    Returns
    -------
    x : 1darray
        Raman shifts values.
    long : 1darray
        corrected intensities.
    eselong : 1darray
        errors calculated as sqrt(y) on raw intensities and propagated after the correction.

    Remarks
    -------

    This correction uses the formula reported in Galeener and Sen (1978), Mysen et al. (1982), Brooker et al. (1988) and Hehlen et al. (2010).

    The 'galeener' equation is the exact one reported in Galeener and Sen (1978), which is a modification from Shuker and Gammon (1970) for accounting of (vo - v)^4 dependence of the Raman intensity. See also Brooker et al. (1988) for further discussion.

    The 'long' equation is that of Galeener and Sen (1978) corrected by a vo^3 coefficient for removing the cubic meter dimension of the equation of 'galeener'. This equation has been used in Mysen et al. (1982), Neuville and Mysen (1996) and Le Losq et al. (2012).

    The 'hehlen' equation is that reported in Hehlen et al. (2010). It actually originates before this publication (Brooker et al. 1988). It uses a different correction that avoid crushing the signal below 500 cm-1. THerefore, it has the advantage of keeping intact the Boson peak signal in glasses.
